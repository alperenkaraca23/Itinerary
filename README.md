# Itinerary

<li> In this application, I have listed the main places that I think should be visited in some cities. </li>
<li> I did this by keeping them in a tableview and redirecting them to a detail page. </li>
<li> On the details page, I made sure to include an important visual of the city and the names of the places I thought should be visited. </li>
<li> Coming to the details of my project, I first created a model for the cities.I put the name of the city, a photo of an important area, and the main places to visit in this model. And I also created an init function. </li>
<li> Then I filled in the tableview. For this, I wrote the cities and places to visit.I have completed this section by making the Tableview settings. </li>
<li> Finally, I created the details page. For this, I ensured that the name and photo information of the city clicked on the tableview was pulled and displayed here. Afterwards, I completed my application by performing usage tests. </li>
